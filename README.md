**Preventing cat returns before they happen — through AI-powered compatibility assessment and post-adoption coaching.**

![ForeverHome AI](public/cat.png)

---

## 🎯 The Problem

**7–20% of shelter cats are returned within 6 months** — not because they're "unadoptable," but because of preventable mismatches between a cat's needs and an adopter's lifestyle. New adopters panic at normal adjustment behaviors (hiding, not eating) because no one explained what to expect. Every return costs shelters time, emotional resources, and capacity — and each returned cat becomes harder to adopt again.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

ForeverHome AI is a **decision-support and adopter-education platform** that helps shelters prevent returns at every stage of the adoption journey. Unlike generic pet apps, every feature is informed by real shelter workflows and cat behavioral science.

### 🔐 Account Required — Full User Journey

The app is a **gated experience** — users must create an account before accessing any tools:

```
1. Login / Register (Google OAuth or Email/Password)
     ↓
2. Onboarding — Role Selection (Adopter or Shelter Staff)
     ↓  (if Adopter)
   Profile Setup: home type, children, other pets, experience, work schedule,
   personality preference, age preference, special needs openness
     ↓  (if Shelter)
   Shelter setup: name, address, phone, email → optional: add cats
     ↓
3. Dashboard — Personalized command center
   • Profile completion status
   • Past assessment history with risk badges
   • Active adoptions with day counter
   • Quick links: Browse Cats, View Report, Open Coach
     ↓
4. Explore Cats → Take Assessment → Get Report → Start 14-Day Coach
```

**Why account-first?** Compatibility data (lifestyle, experience, home environment) must persist across sessions. The 14-day coach requires check-in history. Shelters need verified identities for adoption requests. A demo-only experience can't provide the continuity adopters need during the critical two-week settling period.

### Every Feature — What It Does & Why

| Stage | Feature | What It Does | AI Implementation | Why We Built It |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Pre-Adoption** | Compatibility Assessment | 10-question quiz (5 lifestyle + 5 scenario) → deterministic engine → transparent risk report | **AI Counselor** explains the report in warm, natural language — but never makes the matching decision | Shelters need transparent, auditable matching; AI is perfect for narrative explanation, dangerous for life-altering decisions |
| **Pre-Adoption** | AI Quick Match (Cat Profile) | 4-question chat widget on every cat page gives instant compatibility preview in 30 seconds | Calls `/api/counselor` with adopter answers + cat profile → returns personalized prose | Lowers barrier to assessment; users get instant feedback before committing to the full 10-question quiz |
| **Pre-Adoption** | Whisker Runner Game | Endless-runner platformer with custom cat sprites, progressive difficulty, high scores | No AI — pure Canvas + TypeScript engine with deterministic RNG | Engagement & brand building: keeps users on the platform longer, reinforces cat theme, provides fun mental breaks between serious assessment steps |
| **Pre-Adoption** | Cat Profile Pages | Rich profiles with photo gallery, backstory, personality traits, behavior bars, medical notes, care requirements, ideal home description | No AI in data — AI Quick Match widget provides interactive compatibility preview | Adopters need deep behavioral context before committing; a single photo isn't enough to decide on a 15-year commitment |
| **Post-Adoption** | 9 Lives Protocol | Gamified 14-day curriculum — one challenge unlocked per day, from "The Ghost" (hiding) to "The Commander Ascends" (routine established) | No AI — static expert-written curriculum with actionable tips, behavioral explanations, red-flag warnings | Turns panic-inducing unknowns into named, conquerable milestones; gives adopters a shared vocabulary with shelter staff |
| **Post-Adoption** | AI Coach (Mr. Cat) | Chat interface with cat-specific behavioral advice, photo sharing, daily check-in integration | Calls `/api/coach` — injected with full cat behavioral profile + complete check-in history + current adoption day for context-aware responses | Generic pet advice doesn't help; Mr. Cat knows *this specific cat* and *this specific adopter's history* — contextual guidance is exponentially more useful |
| **Post-Adoption** | Daily Check-ins | 4 toggles (eating, litter, hiding, activity) + free-text note — tracked day-by-day | No AI — structured data feeds into the coach for personalized context | Creates a behavioral timeline shelters can review; declining patterns trigger Smart Escalation |
| **Post-Adoption** | Smart Escalation | Priority ticket to shelter behaviorists with last 3 color-coded check-ins + chat context summary + 24h response badge | No AI in escalation logic — deterministic pattern detection (missed check-ins, declining metrics) | Shelters are short-staffed — they can't monitor every adoption. Escalation surfaces only the cases that need human attention |
| **Post-Adoption** | Deterministic Medical Safety | 26 emergency keywords scanned before every AI call — returns immediate emergency response without contacting AI | **No AI — deterministic pre-scan intercepts AI pipeline** | AI hallucination on medical questions is unacceptable. This is defense-in-depth: emergencies never reach the AI |
| **Shelter Side** | Insights Dashboard | Active adoptions, cats needing attention, common compatibility concerns ranked by frequency | No AI — aggregated statistics from adoption data | Turns individual assessments into organizational learning; shelters can tune their adoption criteria based on real patterns |
| **Shelter Side** | Shelter Console | Cat inventory CRUD, adoption request tracking, staff management, concern analytics | No AI — administrative tools | Shelters need operational tools, not just adopter-facing features |
| **Everyone** | Fun Facts Slideshow | 19 animated cards with rotating cat trivia on the landing page — Egyptian gods, healing purrs, nose prints, space cats, Viking pets, etc. | No AI — beautifully designed static content with auto-rotation and manual navigation | Educational engagement: turns wait time into discovery. Adopters learn about cat behavior even before adopting, setting realistic expectations |
| **Everyone** | TTS Narration | Compatibility reports read aloud via Web Speech API | No AI — browser-native speech synthesis | Accessibility: visually impaired adopters can hear their full report |

### Why No Shelter-Adopter Chat

**We intentionally did NOT build direct messaging between shelters and adopters.** Here's why:

1. **Shelters are severely understaffed** — most shelters operate with 2-5 staff managing hundreds of animals. Real-time chat would create an unsustainable support burden they cannot fulfill.
2. **Unanswered messages cause frustration** — an adopter sending a message and waiting 3 days for a reply creates a worse experience than no chat at all.
3. **The AI Coach fills the gap** — Mr. Cat provides instant, 24/7 behavioral support that shelters physically cannot. For urgent issues, Smart Escalation creates a structured, prioritized ticket rather than an open-ended chat.
4. **Escalation is deliberate, not casual** — requiring adopters to intentionally escalate (rather than casually message) ensures shelter staff only see cases that genuinely need their attention.
5. **Phone/email for real emergencies** — emergency contact information is permanently visible in the coach interface for situations that require immediate human intervention.

This was a deliberate design trade-off: **AI handles 90% of questions instantly → Smart Escalation surfaces the 10% that need humans → shelter staff focus on high-impact interventions.**

### Why a Mini-Game?

Whisker Runner isn't filler — it's strategic:

1. **Retention & dwell time** — hackathon judges and adopters spend more time on the platform when there's something fun between serious features
2. **Brand reinforcement** — the cat dodging obstacles and collecting treats mirrors the adoption journey itself (overcoming challenges, finding rewards)
3. **PWA showcase** — the game demonstrates that the Progressive Web App handles intensive Canvas rendering and keyboard input, proving it's a real app, not just a form
4. **No account required** — the game works for unauthenticated guests, serving as a low-friction entry point before signup
5. **Technical depth** — custom sprite animations, deterministic RNG, collision detection, high score persistence — shows engineering capability beyond CRUD

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔬 Transparent Compatibility Engine (No Black-Box AI)

The core assessment uses **9+ deterministic rules** — no machine learning, no black-box decisions. Every concern is explained with exact rule logic shown to the adopter:

| Rule | What It Checks |
|------|---------------|
| `stress-noise` | High stress sensitivity + noisy household |
| `stress-children` | Not child-comfortable + young children at home |
| `energy-absence` | High-energy cat + 10+ hours away + no vertical space |
| `vertical-space` | Needs climbing space + no enrichment plan |
| `dog-incompatibility` | Dog-unfriendly + resident dog(s) |
| `special-care` | Medical needs + adopter uncomfortable with care |
| `indoor-safety` | Indoor-only requirement + insecure home |
| `unknown-compatibility` | Unknown behavioral data in relevant areas |
| `senior-cat-absence` | Senior with medical needs + long daily absence |
| `fiv-experience` | FIV+ cat + no prior cat/special-needs experience |

**Risk Tiers**: `Low` (0 significant concerns) → `Moderate` (1 concern) → `High` (2+ concerns)

For Moderate/High matches, the engine automatically recommends alternative cats with better compatibility — not to reject the match, but to give options.

### 🗓️ 9 Lives Protocol™ — Gamified Post-Adoption Curriculum

Inspired by the myth that cats have 9 lives, we flipped the concept: instead of losing lives, adopters and cats **survive each challenge together**, building trust daily:

```
Day 1 👻 "The Ghost"        — Surviving the hiding phase
Day 2 🍗 "The Hunger Strike" — Encouraging the first meal
Day 3 🌙 "The 3 AM Zoomies"  — Managing night activity
Day 4 🚽 "The Litterbox Rebellion" — Solving bathroom issues
Day 5 🛋️ "The Furniture Test" — Protecting your couch
Day 6 😺 "The Belly Trap"    — Learning cat body language
Day 7 🪟 "The Window Watcher"  — Managing barrier frustration
Day 8 🏠 "The Scent Swap"    — Expanding territory
Day 9 👑 "The Commander Ascends" — Permanent routine established
Days 10-14: Maintenance Mode — consolidation phase
```

Each day unlocks a new "Life" with actionable tips, behavioral explanations, and red-flag warnings.

### 🤖 Context-Aware AI Coach (Mr. Cat)

Unlike generic pet advice, Mr. Cat is injected with:

- **Full cat behavioral profile** (energy level, stress sensitivity, children/dog/cat compatibility, medical needs)
- **Complete check-in history** (eating patterns, litter habits, hiding behavior, activity level, notes)
- **Current adoption day** (contextualizing what's normal at each stage)
- **Optional photo analysis** — adopter can share a photo; AI describes what it sees

Example: *"I see Barnaby has been eating well (good sign!) but still hiding on Day 3. This is completely normal — let's talk about why..."*

### 🚨 Deterministic Medical Safety Layer

**26 emergency keywords** are scanned before any AI call. If detected, the system returns an immediate medical emergency response without ever contacting the AI:

- "trouble breathing", "seizure", "unconscious", "collapse", "poison", "bleeding", "unresponsive"...

This is defense-in-depth: even if the AI hallucinates, the safety layer catches emergencies first.

### 📊 Shelter Insights Dashboard

- Active adoptions overview with check-in status
- Cats needing attention (missed check-ins, concerning patterns)
- Common compatibility concerns ranked by frequency
- Turns individual assessments into organizational learning

### 🎮 Whisker Runner Mini-Game

An endless-runner platformer built in Canvas + TypeScript where the cat dodges obstacles, collects treats, and competes for high scores. Complete with:
- Custom cat sprite animations (run, jump, idle, hit, celebration)
- Obstacle generation with progressive difficulty
- Deterministic RNG for reproducible levels
- High score persistence (Firestore auth / sessionStorage demo)
- Integration test suite with property-based obstacle testing

### 🗣️ TTS Narration

Compatibility reports feature text-to-speech for accessibility — the Web Speech API reads reports aloud with a configurable speaking rate.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Deterministic compatibility (no AI)** — transparent, consistent, no hallucination risk in matching
2. **Server-side AI only** — Gemini API keys never exposed to the browser
3. **Cascading model failover** — 3 Gemini model tiers with auto-degradation on rate limits
4. **Deterministic safety layer** — medical keywords intercepted before any AI call (defense-in-depth)
5. **Demo-first development** — entire app works without Firebase, using sessionStorage + static data
6. **TypeScript strict mode** — full type safety across entire codebase
7. **No Firebase Admin SDK** — token verification via `jose` against Google JWKS, avoiding service account secrets

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

> **ForeverHome AI is not a replacement for shelter professionals or veterinarians.** It is a decision-support and adopter-education platform designed to help shelters make consistent assessments and provide better post-adoption guidance.

The compatibility assessment is transparent and rule-based — it does not predict outcomes, diagnose behavior, or make adoption decisions. AI is used only to explain structured results and provide behavioral support. Medical concerns are intercepted deterministically and escalated to humans immediately.

## 🏆 HackTheKitty 2026 Judging Criteria

### Technical Execution (25%)
- **151 TypeScript files** in strict mode — no `any` types
- **Next.js 16 App Router** with Turbopack, server-side API routes
- **22 test suites** with property-based testing (fast-check), integration tests, edge case coverage
- **Cascading AI failover**: 3 Gemini model tiers with rate-limit caching and 8s timeouts
- **Durable execution**: deterministic fallback responses when AI is unavailable
- **Clean architecture**: clear separation between deterministic engine (client), AI (server), and data (Firestore)

### Innovation & Creativity (20%)
- **Deterministic compatibility engine** — AI is used to explain results, never to make decisions. This is the opposite of the industry trend toward black-box AI matching
- **9 Lives Protocol** — gamified post-adoption curriculum that turns common failure points into achievement milestones
- **Medical safety layer** — deterministic keyword interception before AI, preventing hallucinated medical advice
- **Whisker Runner** — mini-game reinforcing the brand while providing fun engagement
- **Privacy-first AI logging** — write-only logs, no conversation context stored, immutable records

### Theme Relevance (15%)
- Built for **World Cat Domination Day** — every forever home is a new base of operations
- The 9 Lives Protocol culminates in "The Commander Ascends" — the cat establishes permanent dominion
- Whisker Runner: the cat dodges obstacles (adoption challenges) and collects treats (successful adjustments)
- The entire brand is built around cats ruling their domain from a secure, loving home

### Documentation (10%)
- **Complete README** with architecture, setup, walkthrough, tech stack
- **`docs/architecture.md`** — system design, data flow, design decisions
- **`docs/api.md`** — endpoint reference with request/response examples
- **`docs/security.md`** — OWASP Top 10 coverage + Aikido scan report
- **Code comments** throughout: JSDoc on functions, inline explanations for complex logic
- **Firestore rules** documented per-collection with security rationale

### Security (15%)
- **Aikido Security scan** completed — 6 of 8 findings remediated in code
- **Firestore RBAC**: 10-collection rules with field validation, UID matching, shelter-ownership checks
- **Server-side AI**: Gemini keys never in browser, all calls proxied through API routes
- **ID token verification**: `jose` JWKS validation on every protected endpoint
- **Input validation**: field type + size guards in Firestore rules, TypeScript strict mode
- **Medical safety**: deterministic keyword interception before any AI call
- **Dependency overrides**: serialize-javascript, fast-uri, rollup CVEs patched
- **Full report**: `docs/security.md`

### UX / UI (15%)
- **Warm, cohesive design system**: terracotta-cocoa-cream palette with Nunito typography
- **Dark mode** with warm dark palette
- **Framer Motion** animations throughout
- **TTS narration** for accessibility
- **PWA**: installable on mobile with offline support
- **Smart escalation modal**: color-coded check-in preview, 24h response badge
- **9 Lives timeline**: visual progress tracking with emoji identifiers
- **Responsive design**: mobile-first with hamburger drawer, desktop pill nav
- **Role-aware navigation**: different nav for adopters vs shelter staff vs guests
- **Whisker Runner**: full game UI with sprite animations, score display, dialog flow

## 🐱 World Cat Domination Day

Every forever home is a new base of operations. When cats are properly matched, supported through their transition, and monitored by shelters — they don't just survive. They thrive. And from every secure, loving home, one more cat peacefully rules their domain.
